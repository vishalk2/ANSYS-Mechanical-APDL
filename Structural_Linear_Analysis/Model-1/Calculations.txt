GIVEN:

P = 900 N (FORCE)
E = 2x10^5 MPa (YOUNG'S MODULUS)
v = 0.33 (POISSON'S RATIO)
DIMENSIONS: 4 (LENGTH) x 2 (WIDTH) x 1 (THICKNESS) - (ALL IN "mm")



THEORETICAL SOLUTION:

Sigma_X = P/A = 900/(2x1) = 450 MPa (STRESS in X-Direction)
Delta_X = PL/AE = 900*4/((2x1)*E) = 0.009mm (Deformation in X-Direction)
